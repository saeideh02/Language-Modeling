# Language-Modeling

In this project we have built a language modeling based on WikiText2 dataset.

For this purpose, first we have used a simple 2 layer LSTM network.

Then we tried with AWD-LSTM model and we tried changing some hyper-parameters and adding some techniques.

Our results are shown in the table below:

To use some techniques we are inspired by paper:"Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models"
